# Book-Store-Restful-API
A RESTful API built for managing a book store system. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete book records, handle customer interactions, and manage inventory operations efficiently.
# 📚 Book Store RESTful API

This project implements a RESTful API for a Bookstore system using Java and the JAX-RS framework (Jersey). It enables client applications to perform CRUD operations on books, authors, customers, shopping carts, and orders. The API is stateless, follows REST principles, and uses JSON as the data exchange format.

## 🚀 REST Endpoints Overview

| Resource  | Endpoint Pattern                        | Methods                     |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Books     | `/books`, `/books/{id}`                  | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE      |
| Authors   | `/authors`, `/authors/{id}`              | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE      |
| Customers | `/customers`, `/customers/{id}`          | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE      |
| Carts     | `/customers/{customerId}/cart`           | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE      |
| Orders    | `/customers/{customerId}/orders`         | GET, POST                   |

## ⚙️ Data Models

- **Book**: title, authorId, ISBN, year, price, stock
- **Author**: name, biography
- **Customer**: name, email, password
- **CartItem**: bookId, quantity
- **Cart**: list of CartItems
- **Order**: customerId, total price, order date, items

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Tests conducted using **Postman**
- Functional tests for all endpoints
- Validation tests for input rules (e.g., year, stock)
- Error handling tests using custom exceptions

---

## ⚠️ Exception Handling

- Custom exception classes:
  - `BookNotFoundException`
  - `AuthorNotFoundException`
  - `CustomerNotFoundException`
  - `InvalidInputException`
  - `OutOfStockException`
  - `CartNotFoundException`
- Each exception is mapped to a structured JSON response with appropriate HTTP status codes.
